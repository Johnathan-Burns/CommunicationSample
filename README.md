# ATMEGA328PB-AU Communication Sample Board
## Designed by Johnathan Burns

---

This project is a custom designed prototype with several external serial connectors.

These include:
- 2x SPI Connections
- 2x I2C Connections
- 1x UART Connection
- 1x ICSP Connection (Signals shared with SPI\_CONN\_0)

---

This board is useful when a large amount of serial connectivity is required in a relatively small space. There are several unused pins on the ATMEGA328PB that could be used for additional GPIO connectivity, but this was not required by the design specifications.
